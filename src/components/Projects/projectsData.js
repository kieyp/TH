    title: "University Of Nairobi - Flue Gas Analysis",
    description: `Flue gas analysis is crucial for optimizing boiler performance, ensuring safety, and complying with environmental regulations. The process involves:
    
    - **Maximizing Efficiency**: Adjusting the air-to-fuel ratio to reduce fuel consumption.
    - **Reducing Emissions**: Identifying and mitigating harmful emissions like CO, NOx, and SO₂.
    - **Maintaining Equipment**: Preventing soot buildup and corrosion.
    
    **Detailed Steps for Flue Gas Analysis:**
    
    1. **Preparation**: Follow safety protocols and ensure the boiler is operating under steady-state conditions.
    2. **Equipment Required**: Use a flue gas analyzer, thermocouple, and sampling probe.
    3. **Sampling Procedure**: Insert the probe into the stack, warm up the analyzer, and record readings.
    4. **Calculating Excess Air**: Use the formula based on O₂ readings.
    5. **Interpreting Results**: Evaluate O₂, CO₂, CO, NOx, SO₂ levels, and flue gas temperature.
    6. **Adjustments Based on Analysis**: Modify the air-to-fuel ratio, maintain the boiler, and use quality fuel.
    7. **Reporting and Compliance**: Document results, ensure regulatory compliance, and implement continuous monitoring.
    
    By conducting a thorough flue gas analysis, you can ensure that the diesel-fired boiler operates efficiently and within environmental regulations.`

    title: "University Of Nairobi - Energy Audit",
    description: `Conducting an energy audit for an office involves a systematic process to assess energy consumption patterns and identify inefficiencies. The process includes:

    1. **Pre-Audit Planning**:
       - Gather basic information: office size, layout, occupancy, operating hours, and historical energy bills.
       - Set objectives: Define goals such as reducing energy consumption or improving lighting efficiency.
    
    2. **Data Collection**:
       - Energy Usage Data: Analyze historical data and current meter readings.
       - Equipment Inventory: List and assess electrical equipment, office machinery, lighting, HVAC systems, and building envelope.
    
    3. **Site Inspection**:
       - Conduct a walkthrough, use thermal imaging, and assess indoor air quality.
    
    4. **Analysis and Reporting**:
       - Analyze data, benchmark performance, identify opportunities, and perform a cost-benefit analysis.
    
    5. **Recommendations and Implementation**:
       - Report findings, develop an action plan, assist with implementation, and establish monitoring and follow-up plans.
    
    This process helps in understanding energy usage, reducing consumption, lowering costs, and enhancing sustainability.`
