    description: "This project entailed a comprehensive assessment of the combustion efficiency of a biomass boiler, aimed at ensuring optimal performance and maximizing energy output. The audit incorporated a series of detailed tests and analyses, such as measuring flue gas emissions, evaluating fuel quality, and monitoring combustion temperatures. By thoroughly examining these parameters, we were able to pinpoint inefficiencies and identify specific areas for improvement. The ultimate goal was to enhance the overall energy efficiency of the system, reduce operational costs, and minimize environmental impact. Our findings provided actionable insights that guided recommendations for performance optimization and operational adjustments."
